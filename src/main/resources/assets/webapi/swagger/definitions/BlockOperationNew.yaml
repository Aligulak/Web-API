    description: |
      The UUID of the world that the block update is applied to.

      Either the property `block` or `blocks` has to be set.

      If the property `block` is set then all the blocks within the area defined by `min` and `max` are changed to the specified block.

      If the property `blocks` is set then it defines nested arrays of the blocks within the area defined by `min` and `max`.
      The arrays should contain the blocks such that a block located at [min.X + x, min.Y + y, min.Z + z] can be accessed by `blocks[x][y][z]`,
      where `min` is the vecotor defined by the `min` property.
