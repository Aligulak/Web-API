Setup a Sponge server (Sponge Vanilla & SpongeForge supported)\r\n2. Add this mod to the mods folder\r\n3. Start the server\r\n4. Configure the config files to your needs.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nThe default settings run the server **on localhost only**, which means you cannot access it from another server.  \r\nUsually this is enough, as you most likely will be running a web server / another application that accesses this data on the same server.  \r\n\r\n**PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHO YOU GRANT ACCESS TO THE WEB API, AS PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO THE COMMAND ENDPOINT CAN EXECUTE ARBITRARY COMMANDS\r\nON THE MINECRAFT SERVER, INCLUDING SHUTTING IT DOWN AND DELETING WORLDS!**\r\n\r\nThere is a simple permissions system in place to restrict access to the API. Check out the webapi/permissions.conf file in the config folder.  \r\n**REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT TOKENS THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THE CONFIG FILE**  \r\nYou have to provide a \"user\" and \"token\" if you want to access any api routes. There are two ways to pass these to the server.\r\n* Set the headers \"x-webapi-user\" and \"x-webapi-token\" in the request\r\n* Set the query parameters \"user\" and \"token\" in the request\r\n\r\n## Request / Response types\r\nThis API uses JSON as requeset and response formats.\r\n\r\n## URLs\r\nWhen accessing the base site (by default http://localhost:8080/) a documentation of all the methods will show up. [WIP]\r\nThis can be used as a starting point to explore the supported methods.\r\n\r\n| Path        | Description                                              |\r\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| /           | Base API url, shows a list of all supported paths        |\r\n| /info       | Provides basic information about the minecraft server    |\r\n| /cmd        | Lists all commands & executes individual commands        |\r\n| /players    | Lists all players & information about individual players |\r\n| /worlds     | Lists all worlds & information about individual worlds   |\r\n| /chat       | Provides access to the chat history                      |\r\n| /plugins    | Lists all plugins & information about individual plugins |\r\n",
